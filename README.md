# Flash Cards JavaScript Game

## Approach
Starting off, I decided to outline the necessary steps involved with the game. Since I would need to include an object with an array of all the possible flash card text, titles, images, etc, it made sense to use Handlebars.JS to help with templating that functionality.

## User Stories
* As a user, I should be able to see a flash card, then guess the answer based on the image/word that was shown to me.
* As a user, I should be able to see the answer to the flash card once I've made a guess.
* As a user, I should be able to keep track of my progress in the game through score keeping.
* As a user, I should be able to know when my answer is correct, and when it is wrong.
* As a user, I should know when the game is over.
